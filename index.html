            <hr>
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Attendance</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">We seek your cooperation in impressing upon your children the importance of attending school regularly and "being on time." We ask you to please avoid scheduling appointments for your child during school hours. In the event that such an appointment need be scheduled, please send a note with your child on the day of the appointment. Parents must pick up their child before 2:45 p.m. Parents who pick up their children early must come to the second floor office in order to sign the child out.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Children who are absent from school must present a note explaining their absence, to the homeroom teacher on the day of their return to school. To avoid gaps in learning during absence, arrange with a classmate to bring home assignments and needed books. Students who arrive past 8:00 a.m. must sign in.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">We are sure that you realize that the success of our school program is impaired by excessive and unnecessary interruptions. We urge that you help your child develop a good record of attendance and punctuality.</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="attendance.png" alt="attendance.png">
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Birthday Celebrations</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">In School Birthday Celebrations - Teachers of kindergarten and first grade arrange a monthly birthday celebration for all of the students whose birthdays occur during the month. Parents are usually contacted and asked to supply a portion of the items necessary for the celebration. No other birthday parties are held in school. All students’ birthdays are acknowledged on a daily basis with the presentation of birthday ribbons at morning minyan.</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="birthday.png" alt="birthday.png">
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Care of School Property</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Inculcating respect for the school and school property (building, desks, textbooks) is part of educational program, and we enlist the aid of parents in emphasizing these values to their children. Please help us in preserving the cleanliness and decor of our building.</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="cleanliness.png" alt="cleanliness.png" >
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Cell Phone / Electronic Device Policy</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Cell phones/electronic devices may serve as an outstanding instructional tool and learning resource if used appropriately. We also understand that parents want to be able to communicate with their children in case of an emergency. However, those devices have become tremendous distractions for the learning environment of the school and have been used inappropriately in school (cyber bullying, texting, making phone calls, taking pictures of students and teachers, playing games during instruction). Additionally, over the years, students have increasingly been refusing to abide by the liberal cell phone/electronic device policy that presently exist in our school. It is therefore necessary for us to address the problem by developing a clear cell phone/electronic device policy for SSSQ. Parents must recognize that unless we deal with the problem, we will have difficulty in providing the organization and order necessary for a safe school climate and a good classroom environment.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The cell phone/electronic device policy listed below has been approved by the school’s Board of Trustees and the PTA.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">1. Students may have cell phones/electronic devices in school, but they must be turned off from the time they arrive at school until dismissal at 3:20 PM and must be kept completely out of sight. Cell phones may not be carried in students’ pants pockets, jackets, or placed in their desks. They must be stored in their locker or in their book bag. Cell phones may not be used during recess or lunch period.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">2. Cell phones/electronic devices may only be used for educational purposes in the classroom setting and with the permission of the teacher.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">3. Students may turn on their cell phones/electronic devices only when they are at their dismissal location. They may not be used while walking in the hallways or staircases when walking to the dismissal area.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">4. In the event of an emergency, students will be given authorization by a teacher to use their cell phone.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">5. Parents who may need to communicate an important message to their children during the hours of 8:00 AM and 3:20 PM should call the main office. If students need to contact a parent for an important reason, they should go to the main office and ask a secretary to call home for them.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">6. Should a cell phone ring, vibrate or be used for any reason during the school day without teacher permission, or is visible anytime during the school day, it will be confiscated and given to an administrator.</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="cellphone.png" alt="cellphone.png">
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Choir</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The school choir is directed by our music teacher. It is open to children in grades 4-8 by audition. The choir meets once a week for rehearsals. They perform al various school and community functions during the school year. Children in the choir must have a white collared shirt or turtle neck shirt and navy skirt (girls) or navy pants (boys).</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="choir.png" alt="choir.png">
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Continuation of Enrollment</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">At any time during a child's attendance at Schechter, continued admission can be denied due to academic or behavioral concerns or due to a family's failure to cooperate with school policies. As a school, we are committed to working with the whole child. We understand that matching a child to the appropriate school can be a complicated undertaking. Therefore, after admitting your child, we monitor his/her academic and social progress carefully.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Administrators and other professionals work with your child's teachers to make sure that we can continue to meet your child's needs. Sometimes, we cannot. If this is the case because of an academic or behavioral concern, the school will make timely contact with you so that you can make appropriate arrangements for the following year.</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="continuation.png" alt="continuation.png">
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Discipline</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Rules and regulations are established in any institution to indicate the limits of acceptable social behavior. Discipline in the school is a prerequisite to the creation of an effective learning atmosphere.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The following is a list of disciplinary procedures:</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">1. A child may be referred to one of the principals. Records of such referrals are kept.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">2. Parents may receive notification of persistent problems and may be required to attend a conference.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">3. Guidance services may be sought. When this is deemed necessary parental approval is sought.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">4. Referral for outside testing or counseling: In some cases if a behavior persists, the administration may recommend that the child be referred to an outside facility for diagnostic testing and follow-up.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">5. Removal from class or suspension from school: When unacceptable behavior persists, or on those occasions when a child commits an act which endangers the health and safety of other children (e.g. fighting), or a member of the faculty or destroys school property, it may become necessary to suspend the child from school. If a student's behavior results in a second suspension the same academic year, the suspension shall be for multiple days. If a third incident occurs, a guidance hearing will be held which will include the parents of the child, a member of the administrative staff and the Vice President of Education for consideration of expulsion from the school.</p>
            <img class="imageGuidelines" src="discipline.png" alt="discipline.png">
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Dress Code</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The Board of Education of our school adopted the following dress code for grades K-8. Most schools have found that children who are appropriately dressed and groomed have a more wholesome attitude towards school, and do better academically. The underlying rationale for the Dress Code is that dignity and propriety are called for in the children=s house of learning and house of prayer. Solomon Schechter’s dress code stresses a comfortable, clean, and neat appearance. Students are required to adhere to the dress code during the school year. We request your cooperation in helping us implement the school’s dress code.</p>
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Evaluation and Services</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">1. Testing - Standardized achievement tests are given annually to students in grades 2-8. Additional tests required by the State Education Department and the New York City Department of Education are given also at the appropriate times. Parents recieve notification of test dates as well as results of the tests in school mailings. If needed, conferences are scheduled to discuss the results.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The school maintains a list of professionals in the areas of psychological and educational testing and therapy. If you would like such information, you may call one of the school administrators or the school psychologist.</p>   
            <p class="textGuidelines">If your child is evaluated by an outside professional, it is important for the school to have this information. A parent must request that a report be sent to the school in care of the Headmaster.</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">2. Psychological Assessment - During the Spring, a psychological assessment is administered by a licensed certified school psychologist to all students entering first grade, or students new to our school. There is a nominal fee for this service.</p>
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Extra-Curricular Activities</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The school offers a number of after school clubs for students of all grades for a nominal fee. Participation in clubs is optional. A notice is sent home at the beginning of October, and January, listing all clubs offered for each term. The child may be enrolled when payment and parental permission is received. Each club term consists of approximately ten sessions, which begin at 3:30 p.m., and end at 4:30p.m. On short Fridays clubs begin at 1:30p.m. and end a 2:30 p.m. The parent must provide all transportation for after school clubs.</p>
            <p class="titleGuidelines">Health</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Children coming to school are assumed to be healthy enough to attend the full day's program, including recess and physical education. If a child becomes ill or injured in school, parents will be notified if considered necessary by the school nurse or school administrator. In case a parent is not available the designated emergency contact person will be called. When you are asked to pick up your child, please respect the judgment of the nurse in these situations. The request to take home a child due to illness or injury is motivated by wanting to do what is best for the child and for his/her classmates. Please make sure that the medical records and emergency information on file in the school are kept up to date.</p>
            <p class="titleGuidelines">CHILDREN'S HEALTH/IMMUNIZATION RECORDS</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">Before a child is enrolled at SSSQ, the parent(s) must provide documentation of their child's immunizations and physical examination on the medical form provided in the registration packet. These forms must be completed and signed by a physician before your child begins attending our school. The health immunization form must be updated by the physician and given to the nurse as a child receives new immunizations.misc_131452</p>

            <p class="titleGuidelines">Anti-Bullying Policy</p>
            <p class="textGuidelines">The school maintains a zero tolerance policy against any form of bullying. This includes verbal abuse, physical abuse, written messages or cyber-bullying. Upon report and confirmation of an allegation, successive steps of interventions will begin. These interventions will include conferences with child and/or parent by an administrator or the guidance counselor, suspension and eventual expulsion from school.

Its recent successor, STEAM, also incorporates the arts, which have the "ability to expand the limits of STEM education and application," according to Stem Education Guide. STEAM is designed to encourage discussions and problem-solving among students, developing both practical skills and appreciation for collaborations, according to the Institution for Art Integration and STEAM.<br>
                        <br>Rather than teach the five disciplines as separate and discrete subjects, STEAM integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm based on real-world applications. <br>
                        <br>According to the U.S. Department of Education "In an ever-changing, increasingly complex world, it's more important than ever that our nation's youth are prepared to bring knowledge and skills to solve problems, make sense of information, and know how to gather and evaluate evidence to make decisions."

                        <p><strong>The Objectives of the HUMSS Strand</strong></p>
                        <p>The HUMSS strand curriculum was developed to equip senior high school students looking to pursue more sociological and artistic careers in their future with the necessary skills and confidence. Students enrolled in HUMSS strand courses can expect to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acquire the appropriate mindset and theorems for understanding the psyche and behavior of people across different backgrounds</li>
                            <li>Build their confidence in articulating their various ideas and expressing themselves through both written and spoken language in both scholarly and secular work</li>
                            <li>Provide them with the means to gaining the necessary rapport with their future patients, clients, audiences, and other stakeholders depending on their profession of choice.    </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At OEd, we wish to equip our students to communicate articulately, think critically, and exercise sensitivity and empathy in their professional endeavors.</p>

                        <p>Senior high school (SHS) aims to prepare students with the skills and competencies they need for their desired college courses. This is why many SHS students choose to take up strands that have specialized subjects. However, there will always be students who are still undecided about what they will be taking up at the tertiary level and what career they want to pursue. That’s why the GAS strand in SHS in the Philippines was designed.</p>
                        <p>The GAS strand is created to cater to students who prefer a broader range of studies rather than specific fields. It offers SHS students the flexibility to choose electives from various strands, which helps in choosing a university degree. This article provides an overview of this strand including some courses that they can take for successful career paths in the future. </p>
